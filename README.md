## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned

We learned to cerrectly place and replace objects on the website, change values and work with JavaScript, we improved our skills working with buttons and functions, we have lot of ways how to develop further

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
starting with <div id="darkcyanBg"> and ending with </div> which close it, for me it is the best what i did in this work
```
```css
I proud what I did correctly all things in this work, but class .attribution has it's own role in this work. 
```
```js

function ten(){
tip=bill*0.1;
tipPerPerson=tip/amount;
total=(bill+tip)/amount;
document.getElementById('tipAmount').innerHTML =  "$" + parseFloat(tipPerPerson).toFixed(2) ;
document.getElementById('totalPerPerson').innerHTML =  "$" + parseFloat(total).toFixed(2) ;

}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

Learning deal with animations, and make it easier wo work with them, create code that would work as animation. Another section is developing to deal with buttons, to make them more presentable. 



### Useful resources

https://www.w3schools.com/ - This is an amazing website that helped us to understand some difficulties working with JS. 

https://fontawesome.com/ - This is the website, where we get icons and placed it in our work, which helped us so much.
